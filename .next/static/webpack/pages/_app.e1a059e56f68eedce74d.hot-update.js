This rifle represents the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and its logo is inset in the grip cap. This superb rifle is one you will show off to friends and certainly to pass on to the family. This deluxe rifle offers more embellishments and attractive gold Engraving than your average bolt-action rifle. It has a fine Monte Carlo stock satin-finished Stainless steel barrel and receiver the receiver being etched in gold. A portion of the sale of this rifle goes to the RMEF for assistance in establishing habitat and refuge for elk across America. Some of the unique things you will enjoy. A satin gloss finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood. Rosewood caps on the fore-end and grip offer additional elegance. The high-grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks. The raised cheekpiece helps to direct recoil into the shoulder area and quickly puts the shooter's line of sight in alignment with the scope. Durable low-luster Stainless steel to minimize reflection and provide resistance to corrosion. Matte gold etching on the receiver. Quality first. This X-Bolt features a button-rifled barrel that is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy. The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy. The free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately. It's drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform. The adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the human factor by eliminating creep and take-up providing a crisp trigger pull that breaks like glass.",

The all new CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol) in 9mm Luger has an idealcombination of style, ergonomics, size, shape, accuracy, and ability toconceal comfortably. The new Walther SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowbacktechnology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. Introducing Walthers patented Soft coil design, The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure fromthe ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrelin front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion ofthe slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside ofa cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion ofthe slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has leftthe barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, openingthe breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.The Walther CCP features a  ambidextrous push button magazine release and a manual safety lever on the left side of the gun. The Walther CCP features an accessory rail and features a 5.5 lb trigger pull for the best combination of ease and weight for enhanced shooting characteristics. If you are in the market for a very small and lightweight concealable handgun, then check out the line of CCP pistols from Walther. ",

The new Walther SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowbacktechnology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. Introducing Walthers patented Soft coil design, The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure fromthe ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrelin front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion ofthe slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside ofa cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion ofthe slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has leftthe barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, openingthe breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.The Walther CCP features a  ambidextrous push button magazine release and a manual safety lever on the left side of the gun. The Walther CCP features an accessory rail and features a 5.5 lb trigger pull for the best combination of ease and weight for enhanced shooting characteristics. If you are in the market for a very small and lightweight concealable handgun, then check out the line of CCP pistols from Walther. ",

Advanced lens coatings and electronics produce a crisp red dot. The brightness control dial on the MRO is specifically designed for ambidextrous usage. With a mid-adjustment 'off' position and eight discernible brightness settings, this brightness dial allows for quick and ergonomic adjustments. The MRO features fully protected adjusters that maintain zero even during rough handling, and can be adjusted without the need for special tools.
